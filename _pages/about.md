Currently, I'm a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University, advised by Professor [Stefan Lee](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/). I'm working on the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL): developing agents that understand human language to act accordingly.

My vision is to build AI agents that can cooperate with humans naturally to solve complex tasks, freeing humans from repetitive tasks. Specifically, I'm interested in the following research questions:

- How to make agents ground human language to the physical world?
- How to make agents act accordingly to environment descriptions?
- How to make agents learn from human feedback, interact, and cooperate with humans naturally through language?

Before that, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University, advised by Professor [Stefan Lee](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/) on language-conditioned world models. I also received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City University of Science, advised by Dr. [Minh-Quoc Nghiem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fCsNZTcAAAAJ&hl=en) on text summarization. I also worked with Professor [Jing Jiang](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/jing-jiang/) on visual referring expressions and neural module networks.
