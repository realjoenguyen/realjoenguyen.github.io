Currently, I'm a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University, advised by Professor [Stefan Lee](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/). I'm working on the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL): developing agents that understand human language to interact efficiently with the world.

Before that, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University, advised by Professor [Stefan Lee](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/) on language-conditioned world models. I also received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City University of Science, advised by Dr. [Minh-Quoc Nghiem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fCsNZTcAAAAJ&hl=en) on text summarization. I also worked with Professor [Jing Jiang](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/jing-jiang/) on visual referring expressions and neural module networks.

<span style="color: red !important">I'm actively seeking for a research intern position about NLP and RL in the summer of 2026. If you are interested in collaborations or hiring, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!</span>
